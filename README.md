# PINN for battery recycling

Code for 'Physics-informed learning framework for rapid degradation detection with sparse pulse response data in lithium battery recycling'

# Dataset for rapid degradation detection

'Train_batch1', 'Train_batch2', 'Train_batch3_1', and 'Train_batch3_2' correspond to datasets batch-1, batch-2, batch-3-1 and batch-3-2 in the paper respectively.

'batch1_model','batch2_model', and 'batch3_model' are the equivalent circuit model parameters of datasets batch-1, batch-2, batch-3 respectively.

# Model for rapid degradation detection

The proposed model 'PINN.m' and comparative models 'GPR.m' and 'RFR.m'.
